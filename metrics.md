# GrimoireLab Metrics

A non-comprehensive set of metrics measured by GrimoireLab

* Identities
  * What: Track the same user across multiple profiles
  * Why: Prevents over-counting individual developers and allows more accurate identification of important developers
* Top Repositories
  * What: Measures activity (commits, authors, lines of code, etc.) of multiple scanned respositories
  * Why: Provides a realtive view of repositories within a project to see where activity is concentrated
* Assignee Organizations
  * What: Counts the issues assigned to individual organizations
  * Why: Can indicate which organizations are valued by the community itself
* Mailing Lists: Emails
  * What: Counts the emails send on mailing lists associated with the project
  * Why: Indicates how responsive the mailing lists are via volume of traffic
* Gerrit: Changeset Status
  * What: Counts the changesets of each status
  * Why: Can indicate the current stage of development that the project is in (i.e. a project ramping up for a new release may have more DRAFT issues than NEW)
